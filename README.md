  Niners vs Eagles Week 13 Simulation 2023
</h1>

<h4>

  - My Group and I created a simulation to try and determine the outcome of the Niners vs Eagles game in Week 13 in 2023
  - Utilized Scoring% from Football-Reference to get an idea of how likely each team was to score on a particular drive
  - Adjusted Scoring% by the opposing team's ELO rating to account for better defense
  - Used Red Zone target% to determine the likelihood that a player would get a receiving TD
  - Used season rushing attempts to determine the likelihood of a player to get a rushing TD
  - Ran 1000 simulations and found that the 49ers were expected to win by roughly 3 points
